          <p className={classes.projectinfodescription3}>
            Rock Arts Hub faced challenges in facilitating collaboration between
            geoscientists and artists, who often work in separate silos.
            Communicating complex geoscientific concepts to a broad audience was
            difficult through traditional means. There was limited public
            engagement with geoscience due to its perceived complexity.
            Sustaining long-term interest among participants and overcoming
            resistance from traditionalists in both fields posed additional
            hurdles. Technical and financial constraints in developing and
            maintaining the online platform, as well as securing sufficient
            funding for outreach programs, added to the challenges.

            Rock Arts Hub developed an online platform showcasing
            geoscience-inspired artworks with filters and detailed descriptions
            to enhance understanding. A collaborative space was created for
            geoscientists and artists to connect and work on projects, supported
            by communication and file-sharing tools. A dedicated section offers
            articles, videos, and interactive learning tools to explain
            geoscience through art, catering to various audiences. Workshops,
            seminars, and exhibitions were organized to encourage dialogue and
            engagement, alongside outreach programs for the wider community.
            Networking opportunities were provided to promote interdisciplinary
            collaboration.

            These solutions led to better communication and understanding of
            geoscientific concepts through art, increasing public engagement and
            scientific literacy. Successful collaborations between geoscientists
            and artists resulted in innovative discoveries, with positive

            workshops and exhibitions grew, and educational resources reached a
            diverse audience. The platform received recognition and support from
            academic institutions and cultural organizations. Sustained interest
            and engagement from both communities met the success criteria, and

            financial challenges, ensuring the platforms success.
